# plg_content_db8imageresize
Joomla 3.x Content Plugin to automatically resize an Image after it has been uploaded with Joomla's Media Manager.
You can define multiple image sizes so that with Responsive Design you can use different file formats. 

**Joomla's Media Manager** is used at:

* Back-end > Content > Media > Upload
* Back-end > Content > Articles > New/Edit Article > tab "Images and Links" > Intro Image / Full Article Image


**Note:** If you have **JCE editor 2.5.x as default editor**, its own **File Browser plugin** will replace the "Images and Links" upload.
